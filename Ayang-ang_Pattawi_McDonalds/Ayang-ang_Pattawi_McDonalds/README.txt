NOTES


IMPROVEMENT FOR APPLICATION

1. Only enable/disable the order options depending on the clicked order. For example, 
if Big Mac is clicked, disable in the Add-Ons: Plain Rice, Gravy, and Extra Lettuce.

2. Make it more responsive (quite difficult or near impossible; this is WinForms). Woule be nice
if it were in WPF.

3. Add styles to the DataGridView.

4. Change the Order buttons to a Guna Button to let it have a border radius property. 

5. Add a Settings tab?

6. Add a cancel order. IMPORTANT.
